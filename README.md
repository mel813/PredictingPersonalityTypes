## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your local machine:

* **Python 3:** Make sure Python 3 (e.g., Python 3.9+) is installed.
* **Pip3:** Python's package installer, usually comes with Python 3.
* **PATH Variables:** Ensure Python and Pip are correctly added to your system's PATH variables.
* **Code Editor:** A code editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code.

# Install Python Dependencies:
* Open your CLI/terminal and run the following command to install all necessary Python packages

    '''run pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn'''

# Running the Application

* Run Main.py to train and run the machine learning models. This will also run DataPreprocessing, which will load and clean the dataset. The DataAnalysis.py file can be run to visualize elements of the data set, such as correlation matrix and pairplots.
